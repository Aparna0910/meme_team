# INSPIRATION
## Fun and entertainment was in sheer need to overcome the stress and monotonicity during the covid period. 
## The trend of memes, therefore inspired us to develop a game which would lighten us up for a while.

# DIFFICULTIES
## Initially we tried the model by using tensorflow, but the model was not deployed well and it did not produce a good output.
## Therefore, we tried implementing the model in pytorch using transfer learning and it worked well with better results. 
## We were facing problems while implementing back end and front end, since there were issues while capturing webcam snap. . 

# EXPERIENCE GAINED
## Sometimes it becomes difficult to put the ideas into projects just by watching tutorials. Therefore, we tried something new out of the box  using 
## HTML
## Bootstrap 
## CSS
## and creating ML  pytorch  model
## We implemented these from research paper and it worked really well.
